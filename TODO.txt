``cartouche`` TOODs
===================


Registration
------------

- [_] Define "minimal" registration schema using ``deform``.

      o ``email`` plus "security question" pair are initially-required fields.

      o Seve entered data, along with a quasi-random token and an expiration
        date, in a persistent mapping keyed by e-mail address.

      o Redirect to URL with 'email' in query string.

      o Send confirmation e-mail with token to be cut and pasted into
        the second page.
        
      o Include a link to the confirm page in the mail:  if the user visits
        the link, rather than leaving the browser window open, require that
        they re-enter the security question and answer (?)?

      o Allow configuration of additional registration-tie schema elements,
        to be collected after e-mail is confirmed.  Or maybe just redirect
        to the profile edit view?

- [_] Add e-mail-confirmed user to ``ZODB`` user store

      o Allow user to pick login name, defaulting to e-mail address.

      o Hash password using ``zope.password`` utility.
